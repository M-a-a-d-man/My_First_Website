According to webopedia.com the definition of Spyware is: "Any software that covertly gathers user information through the userâ€™s Internet connection without his or her knowledge, usually for advertising purposes. Spyware applications are typically bundled as a hidden component of freeware or shareware programs that can be downloaded from the Internet; however, it should be noted that the majority of shareware and freeware applications do not come with spyware."
Spyware, is also something that can be used by spies to spy on people, like microcameras and teddy bear cameras. While it could also be a program to track your spendings to be later, to gain knowledge about you to be able to commit an identity theft.
