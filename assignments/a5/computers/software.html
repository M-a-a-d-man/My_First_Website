<h1 class="title">Software Definition</h1>
Software unlike hardware is not a physical component but instead it is a virtual component, think of it as the difference between chess online and
real world chess with physical pieces. Software is a virtual component of a computer, <i>software</i> is a pretty broad term however. Software can be anything from an operating system (see operating system explanation) to a program or an
application, anything that runs on a computer can be typically considered a software (generally speaking, this is not completely true, like a movie that runs on your computer is not a software, but a software is used to play the movie), video games can be software. Software though is more precisely data that has been compiled into binary form so that it can be read and executed by a computer.
Softwares can be copied and installed onto storage device like a Solid State Drive (SSD) or a Hard disk drive (HDD), but can also be stored temporarily into RAM (memory) while being used in the background. Software is made using programming languages by programmers.
