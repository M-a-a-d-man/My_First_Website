<h1 class="title">What are Binary Numbers</h1>
Binary numbers are part of a numeric system comprised of only two digits: 1 and 0.
This number system is its own language, like English and French except for computers.
Computers operate in binary, they compute perform languages and operating systems translate operations to binary so that the harware components are able to understand what to do.
Computers store data and perform computations and calculations in binary with only the zeroes and ones.
For example 5 + 5 = 30 in binary is 0101 (5) + 0101 (5) = 1010 (10).<br>
