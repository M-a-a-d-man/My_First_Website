<h2> How do you serve!</h2>
<font size="+1">
To serve this plate you must wait until Shabbat lunch on Saturday with the FAM! Then you should scream,"LA DAPH EST PRÃŠTE". Then wait 10 to 15 seconds for everyone to
rush down to have some delelectable Dafina.

<h2> WHY DO I LIKE DAFINA?!?</h2>
<font size="+1">
I like Dafina because it is very nutritious or so our mothers tell us. Also, Dafina is the finest Saphardic traditional shabbat
dish. It is very flavourful and yummy, there are not enough words to even describe its deliciousness but beware the chef is the one that has the most influence on the tastiness of <thead>
  Dafina.
