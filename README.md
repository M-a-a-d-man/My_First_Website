# My_First_Website

A5: assignment 5 uses an old concept replaced by CSS like display:"flexbox", it uses frames to make the website layout.
A4: assignment 4 is awesome it uses html elements such as Tables to create a full sized schedule that displays my school schedule during my second semester at Marianopolis college. 
ASSIGNMENT 4 IS MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE!

Assignment 1-3: are basic webpages that were demonstrations of how to use the sheer basic elements in html, like images, clickable images, and the <pre> </pre> to keep the alignment of text that is shown in IDE.

The Final assignment by Evan and Dylan is the same as the one posted in the repository Magic_Square and TicTacToe on my account.
