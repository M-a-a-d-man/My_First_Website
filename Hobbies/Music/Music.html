<h2> Listening to Music </h2>

I have a passion for listening to music. When I was younger I used to make music in the Mac app called
GarageBand and we used to make epic beats it was awesome.
My cousin taught how to use Garageband and LogicProX. But I LogicProX is too expensive now so I stopped making music.
Now, I make playlists frequently to change my rotation of songs. I like rap, R&B (Rhythm and Blues),
I love pop as well and my all time favourite is EDM, also known as Electronic Dance Music.
