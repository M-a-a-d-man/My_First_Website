I absolutely love to watch Television, I love many different genre, but my favourite shows are the ones that
teach me a lesson such as never giving up or putting hard work is all it takes to succeed. I love to see characters
develop and evolve and live their lives seeing the evolution of their character from fearful goofball to stoic leader
that leads the nation, this show is called <i>Naruto</i>, another great show is called <i>Game of Thrones</i>, a popular show on HBO.
<i>Game of Thrones</i> explores darker themes however that are less appealing and much more grim and gruesome. I love entertainment in general,
I like to watch Youtube as well to learn, for example recently I watched a video on how to assemble a PC because I will soon be switching from MacOS to
Windows 10 Education, which is free luckily from Marianopolis. Youtube is my go-to, although I prefer watching TV the length of Youtube
videos are short enough to squeeze in between homework breaks and lunch breaks.
